**Homie device** - same as MqGateway - it is not the same as "device" (see below)

**Device** - sensor or controller connected to MqGateway (e.g. relay module or switch button)

**Point** - each place connected to MqGateway with single ethernet/UTP cable, can have many devices connected to it

**Room** - space containing multiple points, it helps divide configuration into logical parts, but has currently no other influence on how MqGateway works (e.g. kitchen which has multiple light switches)

**Wire** - single wire of UTP cable which may be used to connect one digital device
