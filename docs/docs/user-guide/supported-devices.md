This is a list of devices currently supported by MqGateway. That means you can connect a device with digital wires to MqGateway.

All supported devices need to be compatible with 5V power supply.

!!! danger
    Electricity can be very harmful!    
    Please do not connect anything to electricity yourself if you don't have enough knowledge, 
    and you are not completely sure what you are doing.   
    
!!! warning
    Information below has been provided as a pointer. I've tried to prepare it as accurately as I was able to. However, it may contain errors.
    Always check the device manual and do not connect electrical wires if you are not absolutely sure you know what you're doing.
    


### Digital devices

#### Relay module
Relay module which allows turning on/off electrical devices and lights. Controlled with LOW signal by default.

- configuration type: `RELAY`
- additional configuration:
    - `triggerLevel` [one of: **LOW**, HIGH] - The signal LEVEL which triggers the relay and closes the circuit
    - `haComponent` [one of: **switch**, light] - type of the entity for Home Assistant MQTT discovery

```yaml
[...]
rooms:
- name: "workshop"
  points:
  - name: "point with relay"
    portNumber: 1
    devices:
    - name: "workshop light"

      wires: ["BLUE"]
      type: RELAY
      config:
        triggerLevel: "HIGH"
        haComponent: "light"
```
</details>

??? example "Wiring"
    Both solid-state (SSR) relay and electromechanical (EMR) relay module working with 5V power can be used. Relay should be controlled with LOW signal.  
    Any digital wire can be used for communication: blue, blue-white, green, green-white.

#### Switch button
Switch button or push button.

- configuration type: `SWITCH_BUTTON`
- additional configuration:
    - `debounceMs` [default: 50] - number of milliseconds for debounce (helps to avoid flickering)
    - `longPressTimeMs` [default: 1000] - if switch button is pressed for longer then this value (in milliseconds) then "long press" event is sent from MqGateway

    Orange-white wire (GND) and one of the digital wires (blue, blue-white, green, green-white) should be used.


#### Emulated switch
Emulates switch button press with changing digital output from HIGH to LOW for 500ms and back to HIGH state. It is useful for controlling devices 
which has possibility to connect switch button (e.g. garage gate opener).

- configuration type: `EMULATED_SWITCH`
- additional configuration: NONE

            wires: ["BLUE_WHITE"]
            type: EMULATED_SWITCH
```
</details>

??? example "Wiring"
    Emulated switch is realized using electromechanical relay (EMR - the most common type). 
    
    Between MqGateway and the relay:
    
    | WIRE COLOR                           | RELAY PIN |
    |--------------------------------------|-----------|
    | orange (5V)                          | VCC / D+  |
    | orange-white (GND)                   | GND / D-  |
    | [any-digital](../hardware/wiring.md) | IN        |
    
    
    Between the relay and gate opener, use COM and NO on the relay. On the gate opener side - connect wires according to your gate opener manual 
    for connecting wall switch button.

??? example "Wiring"
    Single button gate (garage door) is realized using electromechanical (EMR) relay module to emulate push button.
    Relay should be controlled with LOW signal.

    Between MqGateway and the relay module:
    
    | WIRE COLOR                           | RELAY PIN |
    |--------------------------------------|-----------|
    | orange (5V)                          | VCC / D+  |
    | orange-white (GND)                   | GND / D-  |
    | [any-digital](../hardware/wiring.md) | IN        |

    Relay module should be connected with COM and NO to the gate (garage door) opener in the place for connecting push button.  
    
    | RELAY CONNECTOR      |                        |
    |----------------------|------------------------|

    | NC                   | nothing                |

    Three buttons gate (garage door) is realized using 3-channel electromechanical (EMR) relay module to emulate push button for each function. 
    Relay module should be controlled with LOW signal.
    
    Between MqGateway and the 3-channel relay module:
    
    | WIRE COLOR                           | RELAY PIN |
    |--------------------------------------|-----------|
    | orange (5V)                          | VCC / D+  |

    | [any-digital](../hardware/wiring.md) | IN2       |

    Each relay module should be connected with COM and NO to the gate (garage door) opener in the place for connecting push button.
    This connection needs to be repeated for each relay - button.
